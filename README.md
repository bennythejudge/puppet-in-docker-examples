# Puppet-in-Docker examples

[![GuardRails badge](https://badges.production.guardrails.io/bennythejudge/puppet-in-docker-examples.svg)](https://www.guardrails.io)

[Puppet-in-Docker](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-in-docker)
provides a series of Docker images containing Puppet software. This
repository builds on those images with various examples, from running
Puppet on container-centric operating systems to building a full Puppet
stack ontop of a container scheduler.

So far we have the following demos:

* [PhotonOS](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-in-docker-examples/tree/master/photonos) - run Puppet on a VMware PhotonOS host
* [Atomic](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-in-docker-examples/tree/master/atomic) - run Puppet on a CentOS Atomic host
* [CoreOS](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-in-docker-examples/tree/master/coreos) - run Puppet on CoreOS
* [Docker compose](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-in-docker-examples/tree/master/compose) - standup a Puppet Server stack using Compose
* [Puppet at runtime](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppet-in-docker-examples/tree/master/puppet-at-runtime) - use Puppet inside a new container without it being part of the original image

If you have suggestions for further examples, or if you've put something
interesting together using Puppet-in-Docker, let us know by opening an
issue or a pull request.
